Work for a schjool report company,
Help teachers find out how students perform on tests
Get a string of many values of test results
Generate a report on top of that 

Input = Red, green, amber
Output = Number of occurences of each

As a user I would like to be able to sumbit a string
The string will be several occurences of different colors
I'd like the output to be the amount of times that each color appears
